Q->Consider the following pseudo function with a doubly linked list head
void doSomething(List head)
{
    List temp = NULL;
    List current = head;
 
    while (current !=  NULL)
    {
        temp = current->prev;
        current->prev = current->next;
        current->next = temp;
        current = current->prev;
    }
     if(temp != NULL )
        head = temp->prev;
}
What will be the content of following lists if head of them will be passed to this function? ï»¿(Write elements separated by space just like the inputs).

Ans->
1.  1 2 3 4 5 ->  5 4 3 2 1
2.  1 1 2 2 3 3 ->  3 3 2 2 1 1
3.  4 3 2 5 6 ->  6 5 2 3 4
