Q->What the following pseudo function do on a linked list (tail refers to the last node of list)?

int doSomething(List tail)
{
  List t = tail -> prev;
  tail -> prev = t -> prev;
  t -> prev -> next = tail;
  return t -> data;
}

Ans->It deletes the second last node and returns the value at second last node
