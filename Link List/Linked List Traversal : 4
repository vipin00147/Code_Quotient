Q->What must be placed at blank in below pseudo code, so that it will reverse a singly linked list correctly: -
void reverse(List head)
{
    List prev = NULL;
    List current = head;
    List next;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        next  = current->next; 
        current->next = prev;  
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    _____________________________________
}

Ans-> head = prev;
